  <p class="meta">Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <p>You can delete your account and all associated data at any time. We will remove your cloud save, local data, and revoke authentication.</p>

  <h2>If you have the app installed</h2>
  <p>Delete your account directly in the app:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open The Last Siege - Tower Defense</li>
    <li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong></li>
    <li>Under <strong>Account</strong>, tap <strong>Delete Account</strong></li>
    <li>Confirm the deletion (two-step confirmation)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This permanently deletes your account and all game data.</p>

  <h2>If you cannot access the app</h2>
  <p>If you have uninstalled the app, lost your device, or cannot access it for any reason, you can request account deletion by email:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Email: <a href="mailto:tancauschy@gmail.com">tancauschy@gmail.com</a></li>
    <li>Subject: <strong>Account Deletion Request</strong></li>
    <li>Include: your player ID (if you know it), or the email address linked to your account (Google Play Games, Unity account)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We will process your request and confirm deletion within 30 days.</p>

  <h2>Third-party data</h2>
  <p>We delete your data from our systems and Unity Gaming Services. Third-party platforms (e.g., Google Play Games) may retain data according to their own policies. You may need to manage those separately.</p>
